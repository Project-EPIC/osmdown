Sample OSMDOWN FILE
===================

#Yahoo, this is a test of what works and what doesn't work!

```
var x = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
```

More markdown down here, this should be a paragraph.

> Here I'm going to quote something

And here I'll say what that quote was about and who wrote it.

```
var y = x.length
var z = y*y
```

That was an example of doing javascript in the code block, now I want to use that data here.

Can I reference z = {{ z }}?

##Totally cool -- it actually works, neat!

```
var users = osmdata.experienced_contributors //This will know to load the appropriate JSON file
var graph = osmviz.graph('this should be a graph here')
var fs = require('fs')
var data = fs.readFileSync('./test/ebird.geojson', 'utf-8')
var options = {name: 'ebird'}

var map = osmviz.map(data, options)
```

{{ map }}
